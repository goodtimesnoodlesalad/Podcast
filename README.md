# Podcast
In 2016, I launched <a href="http://bscpodcast.libsyn.com">Say Hello To Your Friends</a>, a podcast about <em>The Baby-Sitters Club</em> book series. Each episode reviews one book from the series and features one or two guests.

## Tech
The podcast is hosted with <a href="http://libsyn.com">Libsyn</a>. I started out using <a href="http://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>, but migrated to Libsyn after I discovered that it offered more features for a comparable price. I record and edit using <a href="http://audacityteam.org">Audacity</a>, as well as <a href="http://zencastr.com">Zencastr</a> for remote interviews. 

## Marketing
I promote the podcast using <a href="http://twitter.com/bscpodcast">Twitter</a> and by seeking out friends and aquaintances to appear on the show.
